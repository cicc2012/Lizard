To distinguish individual lizards, the following features are typically suitable:

1. Scale Patterns:
The arrangement and texture of scales are often unique to individuals.
High-resolution images can capture these details for analysis.
2. Coloration and Markings:
Unique color patterns, spots, or stripes on the body, head, or tail.
These features are often species-specific but can also vary among individuals.
3. Facial Features:
The shape and structure of the head, eyes, and jawline.
Similar to facial recognition in humans, these features can be used for identification.
4. Body Shape and Size:
Variations in body proportions, tail length, or limb size.
Useful when combined with other features.
5. Scars or Injuries:
Permanent scars, missing toes, or other injuries can serve as unique identifiers.
6. Infrared or Thermal Patterns:
If available, thermal imaging can reveal unique heat distribution patterns.
7. Geometric Features:
Key points like the distance between eyes, nostrils, or other anatomical landmarks.
These can be extracted using computer vision techniques.
8. Behavioral Features (Optional):
If video data is available, movement patterns or behaviors can also help distinguish individuals.
